    🌍 **Open API for Urban Air Quality Monitoring**

    This API provides real-time and historical environmental data for urban air quality monitoring, including:

    - 🌡️ **Air quality metrics** (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, SO2, temperature, humidity, etc.)
    - 📍 **Monitoring stations** (IoT sensors, official stations, external data sources)
    - 📈 **Historical time-series data** with flexible date range queries
    - 👥 **Citizen contributions** for community-driven environmental monitoring
    - 🔌 **External data integration** (HTTP APIs, MQTT brokers)

    ## 📊 Data Sources & Updates

    - **Real-time IoT data**: Updated continuously via MQTT
    - **OpenAQ Air Quality Data**: Integrated from OpenAQ API (https://openaq.org/)
    - **External APIs**: Configurable polling intervals (default: 60 minutes)
    - **Citizen contributions**: Community-uploaded environmental data
    - **Storage**: MongoDB with NGSI-LD compliant data models
